    "Did you know that you can classify text into distinct, predefined classes with LLMs like ChatGPT?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes it's possible and I'll show you how. \n",
    "\n",
    "The big advantage is that these LLMs have a lot of knowledge and text understanding capabilites already encoded in their parameters. This means that their ability to do text classification without any pre-training is really high. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is very interesting if you don't have a lot of labeled training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use the task of sentiment analysis as an example in this notebook. We'll load a dataset with movie reviews and our task is to classify them to be either \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's import all the libraries we need. We will also use OpenAIs API and their GPT-3.5-turbo model. Additionally we will leverage their function calling capabilities through a library called [instructor](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor). This ensures that the get back only the labels \"POSITIVE\" or \"NEGATIVE\" and nothing else. "
